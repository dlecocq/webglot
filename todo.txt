1. Determine option-passing (GL_DOUBLE, GL_RGBA, etc.) in WebGL context creation
2. Determine how JavaScript does its timing, both for framerate counting and for time dependence in the rendered primitives.
3. Determine how typecasting works in JavaScript (see grid_dl_gen)
4. Add in support for display options
5. Determine how callbacks will work in WebGL - do they have to be manually handled in the html? With "onclick", etc?
6. Determine if JavaScript supports inheritance
7. Add in support for refresh_dls
8. Determine if JavaScript allows for JavaScript source to include other source.  Basically, the JavaScript analog of "#include <...>"
9. How does the equivalent of glutMainLoop work?
10. In scalar_field.js - change indexVBO to STATIC_DRAW if possible
